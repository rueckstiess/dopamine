- different estimators for FQI. RBF linear regression.
- discretizer visualization
- get cart_vq_q working. with or without adaptClusters?
- move __init__() from estimators to the Estimator base class
- check if the same is needed for the controllers?

- check discretization adapters. working? needed?
- check FiniteDifference agent. seems not to work anymore.
- create a grid discretization adapter
- use KNN for continuous actions (arg max Q is datapoint with highest value)
